No goblins in our farm is a casual game where you have to prevent the steal of your crop and prevent that your income reaches zero, in that case, you lose.

# Basics
When a goblin steal any crop, you have to give it to your farmmate "Eban, the generic farmer", he will replant what was stolen at the final of the round.

The game is in a infinite loop, so the idea is beat your best amount of waves posible.
